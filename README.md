A Matlab project that implements different tsasks: Implemented image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in MATLAB, aiming to
transform high-dimensional image data into a lower-dimensional space. This project explores two distinct algorithms for computing principal components: one based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and the other utilizing the covariance matrix.
